These daemons will wait for new devices attached and set different things for them.

What they can do now:
  1. Set up Xkbmap and Rate for keyboards on plug.
  1. Mount usb storage on plug.

What we plan to teach them to do:
  1. Reconfigure RandR when you plug/unplug your monitors.
  1. Run custom scripts on events.
